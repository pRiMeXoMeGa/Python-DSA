## 1. Leaders in an Array

**Problem Description**
Given an integer array **A** containing **N** distinct integers, you have to find **all the leaders** in array **A**. An element is a leader if it is **strictly greater than** all the elements to its **right side.** **NOTE**: The rightmost element is always a leader.

**Problem Constraints**
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^8

**Input Format**
There is a single input argument which a integer array **A**

**Output Format**
Return an integer array denoting all the **leader elements** of the array.

**Example Input**
Input 1:
```
 A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
```

Input 2:
```
 A = [5, 4]
```

**Example Output**
Output 1:
```
[17, 2, 5]
```

Output 2:
```
[5, 4]
```

**Example Explanation**
Explanation 1:
```
 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.
```

Explanation 2:
```
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 4 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these two elements i.e [5, 4], we can also any other ordering.
```

## 4. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks I

**Problem Description**
Say you have an array, **A**, for which the **i**th element is the price of a given stock on day **i**.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Return the **maximum** possible profit.

**Problem Constraints**
0 <= **A.size()** <= 700000

1 <= **A[i]** <= 10^7

```
A = [1, 4, 5, 2, 4]
```

```
4
```

**Example Explanation**
Explanation 1:
```
Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 1.
```

Explanation 2:
```
Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 2.
```

## 5. Amazing Subarrays

**Problem Description**
You are given a string **S**, and you have to find all the **amazing substrings** of **S**.
An amazing Substring is one that starts with a **vowel** (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

**Problem Constraints**
1 <= length(S) <= 1e6
S can have special characters

**Input Format**
Only argument given is string S.

**Output Format**
Return a single integer X mod 10003, here X is the number of Amazing Substrings in given the string.

**Example Input**
Input:
```
ABEC
```

**Example Output**
Output:
```
6
```

**Example Explanation**
Explanation:
```
Amazing substrings of given string are :
1. A
2. AB
3. ABE
4. ABEC
5. E
6. EC
here number of substrings are 6 and 6 % 10003 = 6.
```

## 6. Even Subarrays

**Problem Description**
You are given an integer array **A**.
Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of **even length** such that the **first** and **last** element of all subarrays will be **even**.
Return "**YES**" if it is possible; otherwise, return "**NO**" (without quotes).

**Problem Constraints**
1 <= |A|, A[i] <= 106

**Input Format**
The first and the only input argument is an integer array, A.

**Output Format**
Return a string "YES" or "NO" denoting the answer.

**Example Input**
Input 1:
```
 A = [2, 4, 8, 6]
```

Input 2:
```
 A = [2, 4, 8, 7, 6]
```

```
 "YES"
```

```
 "NO"
```

**Example Explanation**
Explanation 1:
```
 We can divide A into [2, 4] and [8, 6].
```

Explanation 2:
```
 There is no way to divide the array into even length subarrays.
```

## 7. Bulbs

**Problem Description**
A wire connects **N** light bulbs.

Each bulb has a switch associated with it; however, due to faulty wiring, a switch also changes the state of all the bulbs to the right of the current bulb.
Given an initial state of all bulbs, find the **minimum number** of switches you have to press to turn on all the bulbs.
You can press the same switch multiple times.
**Note:** **0** represents the bulb is off and **1** represents the bulb is on.

**Problem Constraints**
0 <= N <= 5Ã—105
0 <= A[i] <= 1

**Input Format**
The first and the only argument contains an integer array A, of size N.

**Output Format**
Return an integer representing the minimum number of switches required.

**Example Input**

## 8. Pick from both sides!

**Problem Description**
You are given an integer array **A** of size **N**.
You have to perform **B** operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array **A**.
Find and return the **maximum possible sum** of the **B elements** that were removed after the **B** operations.

**NOTE:** Suppose **B = 3**, and array A contains 10 elements, then you can:
* Remove 3 elements from front and 0 elements from the back, OR
* Remove 2 elements from front and 1 element from the back, OR
* Remove 1 element from front and 2 elements from the back, OR
* Remove 0 elements from front and 3 elements from the back.

**Problem Constraints**
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= B <= N
-103 <= A[i] <= 103

**Input Format**
First argument is an integer array **A**.
Second argument is an integer **B**.
